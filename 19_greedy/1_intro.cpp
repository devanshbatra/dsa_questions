// Greedy method is an approach to find an optimal solution for a problem.
// It involve choosing the locally best option at every operation/step.
// It is not guaranteed that you always get the best solution or correct solution using greedy method.
// for eg: in the problem , a tree given and you have to find the path from root to leaf having the largest sum
// of nodes. here a greedy method may redirect you into a wrong branch yieling a wrong solution.

// for eg2: let's take the problem of coin change.
//here greedy approach would work absolutely fine and will yield a correct solution.

//in greedy solutions we are doing some thing like :
//- min , max, sort, using set, priority queue, custom comparator.
