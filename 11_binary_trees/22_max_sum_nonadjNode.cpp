/*
Maximum sum of non adjacent nodes (VERY GOOD CONCEPT AND VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION)
    https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sum-of-non-adjacent-nodes/1
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset
 of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two 
 chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our
  sum then we canâ€™t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.


    approach: We will find two values at each node(starting from end).
        1st will be the sum if we include this node and second will be the sum if we don't include.
        if(root==NULL) return <0,0>

        while backtrack
        //includes  = this->data + not includes of left and right.
        //notinclude= max(inc, notinc left) + max(inc, notinc right);

        TC = O(n)
        SC = O(h) == O(n) for skew tree.
