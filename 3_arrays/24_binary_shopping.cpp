// Solve before seeing approach

// Here we evaluate character arrays
// and have to do exactly two flips so if both flips are done in one condition then its ok
// But if count value is still remaining then we need to check if count is 0 or 1
// if count is 0 then no problem, no need to do anthing, it will be assumed that we fliped a 0 two times
// else if its 1 then we have to flip the first digit.
