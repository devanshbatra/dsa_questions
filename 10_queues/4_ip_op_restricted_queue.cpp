/*
Types of queue includes:
queue simple
circular queue
input restricted queue
output restricted queue
doubly ended queue.

here we will talk about i/p and o/p restricted queue
1> Input restricted queue - Here we can push only at the front. But can pop from from front and back
                so functions available would be: push_front, pop_back and pop_front.

2> Output restricted queue - Here we can pop only at the back(property of normal queue). But can push
                 from from front and back
                so functions available would be: push_front, push_back and pop_back.
